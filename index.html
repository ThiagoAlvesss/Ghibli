            <p>
              Susuwatari, also known as "soot sprites," are small, black,
              dust-like creatures that appear in various Studio Ghibli films,
              particularly in "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Spirited Away." They are
              depicted as playful and mischievous beings that inhabit dusty
              corners of houses and other places. Susuwatari are often seen
              helping to clean up dust and dirt, but they can also cause
              mischief if disturbed.
